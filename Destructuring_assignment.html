      /* let obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4, e: 5 }; 

let a = obj.a;
let b = obj.b;
let d = obj.d;
To destructure an object, you will list the declaration (let or const) and the property names you want to extract between curly braces {} on the left-hand side of the assignment operator. On the right side of the assignment operator, you will use the name of the object that contains the properties you’d like to access.

Here is an example of a destructured object:

let { a, b, d } = obj; //destructuring the ‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘d’ properties from the obj object 
console.log(a, b, d); // prints 1 2 4 */

      // Pro Tip: The syntax on the left of the assignment operator is not an actual object, it just mimics its shape. This is called the destructuring binding pattern.

      const person = {
        name: "Alice",
        age: 30,
        city: "New York",

      let { name, age, city } = person;
      //console.log(person)

      const student = {
        id: 123,
        firstName: "John",
